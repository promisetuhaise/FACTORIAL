# The Fibonacci sequence 
**is a series of numbers in which each number (called a Fibonacci number) is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.**

The factorial sequence begins with:

 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...


# The factorial sequence 
**is a series of numbers where each number in the sequence is the factorial of a non-negative integer.**

The factorial sequence begins with:

0!=1

0!=1
1!=1
1!=1
2!=2
2!=2
3!=6
3!=6
4!=24
4!=24
5!=120
5!=120
6!=720
6!=720
Thus, the factorial sequence is:

1,1,2,6,24,120,720,…
1,1,2,6,24,120,720,…
